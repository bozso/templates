# Templates

Templates mainly written in and for Golang's template
[language](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/)
for generating html. Used by programs I write.

## Goals

- maintain a readable set of templates that can be used with Go's
template language
- extend the Go template defualt functions with additional functions
that can be useful
